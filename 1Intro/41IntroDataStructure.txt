Data structure:
arrangement of collection of data items so that they can be utilized efficiently, and operation can be done efficiently inside the main memory during execution the program.
During the execution of program how the program will manage data inside the main memory and operation.

data structure is a running program forms in main memory.
ex: array, linked list, tree, hash table etc.

main component

1. Ram : 
A primary, temporary or working memory.
2. CPU : execute the instruction or program
3. HSS/SDD : permanent storage where programs be install


database: 
large size data  arrangement on disk
arranging the data in some model like rdmbs, dbms etc. in the permanent storage so that it can be retrieve or to accessed by application easily.

dataware house: 
huge data amount that store and arrangement in the form of  array of disk. 
it is like commercial data that can be -
operational data - daily use data
legacy data - kept as storage some were, if required we fetch and execute.

kept large size data acting as historical data for any commercial form and that is known as dataware house that help on decision making.

big data:
storing and utilizing very large size of data that study is big data, used in internal 


comparison of different data name

data structure: inside main memory during execution of program arrangement of data in main memory in data structure.
database: large size of dta arrangement of dta on disk in database.
dataware house: huge size of data that is be in inactive mode, utilized on required, arrangement of data in array of disk.
big data: storing utilizing very large size data 



4.2
static vs dynamic memory allocation

memory divided into addressable unit into bytes. every block have address having linear single value having own address.
0-65535=65536=64*10^24=64kb

entire main memory not used as single unit but it is divided into manageable pieces that is known as segment.

How a program use main memory
main memory divided into three different parts
1. code section: 
where program resides and its size is not fixed fluctuate as program size required to execute.
2. heap:
piling up, if the things are kept one another or just randomly. heap is used in two case-
a. if things are properly organized like tower
b. if not but looking like a tower
heap word can eb used for organized or unorganized things
in main memory heap is used as unorganized memory but stack is organized
program can access inside code section but can not access directly to the heap memory but can access by using using pointer only and over the policy.

3. stack
it keeps activation record also called stack frame of main function
as the stack property is keeps create variable functions one upon one and destroy after termination of program.


working and uses of memory

once the compile the code/ or runt any program the compiled code comes into code section.
processor start execution
then main function, other functions or variable create(into stack or heap as per defined into program).
once the program end all the function, variable keep destroy (need to free space in heap by define in program)


types of data structure
1. physical data structure - array, liked list etc.
2. logical data structure - tree, graph, hash etc.

physical dta structure:
it decide and define how the memory organized allocation. 
ex array, liked list

array:
collection of contiguous memory location and locate side by side. all elements are together at one place, with fix size means static and size of array can not be increase after create with size.
array can be created inside stack or heap.
use: when know max no of elements to store.

linked list:
collection of node and each nodes contain data and link number of next node.
it is dynamic data structure
its list can grow and reduce dynamically so it is having variable length.
linked list can be created in only heap.
head may be in stack that can be pointer.
use: when size of list is unknown

the physical data structure define how memory should be organized for storing the elements of data and they are more related memory.


physical data structure means for storing data in the memory and on that we need to perform some operation like insertion, deletion, deletion, update, etc. then how its all will be done with following ---
a particular discipline that defined by that logical data structure.

the logical data structures are actual used in application used in algorithm, and to implementing these data structure we use array or liked list.

finally logical data structures are implemented using physical data structure.


ADT - Abstract Data types

Data type:
it is having two things-
how to represent the data
operation on data

int x; //in c or c++
if is take 2byte
then it create 16 bites

representation in side in memory
1st bit for sign that can be + or -
and rest over for number

operation can be arithmetic operations 
like +, -, *, /, % also ++, -- pre and post

Abstract:
hiding internal details
lwt we are not going to know internal binary operation but only data representation and operation. so the internal details are abstract for us.
the abode example of primitive data type

Abstract data type:
it is related to OOP language
using class we can define our own data type that are abstract data type without knowing internal details as can use them

ex list defined as ADT
collection of elements or list
 representation of data
 data 
 1. space for storing elements
 2. capacity
 3. size of list no of elements
operation to perform on list

add(x)
remove()
search(key)


ADT
define the data and operation on data together and let is be used as data type by hiding all the internal details.
a class having representation of data nd operation

operations on list
add(element)
add(index, element)
remove(index)
set(index, element)
get(index)
search(key)
sort()
reverse
combine
merge
split


time and complexity

computer are used for performing computation task. so computation also need time.
it depends on process or procedure for compiling that task..
time complexity depends on the procedure that are adopting.



case I;
depends of number of element
for(i=0;i<n;i++)    --> o(n)


case II;
depends of number of element
for(i=0;i<n;i++)    --> o(n)
{ for(j=0;j<n;j++)    --> o(n)

total time complexity = o(n^2)

case III:
process rest of element beginning at 1st element
process rest of element beginning at 2nd element
process rest of element beginning at 3rd element
-
-
-

n(n-1)/2

degree of polymorphism o(n^2)


case IV:
when something successively divided until it reaches one that represented as log 
like log2(n)
for(i=n;i>1;i/2)

when for loop is not increasing one by one every time then prefer to use while loop
and for loop is used for counter which are incrementing by one.
ex: binary tree (spending time upon a tree along height of tree)

if process all elements on the writing program
--> o(n)

case V:
linked list

if in the form of matrix
if processing only row --> o(n)
if processing only column --> o(n)
if row and column both --> o(n^2)

case VI:
array linked list

considering array also --> o(m+n)
not considering array  --> o(n)



Recursion
==========
a function call itself called as Recursion and inside recurve function must be some condition which will make recursion to stop and terminate.

Recursion function format:
type functionName(parameter)
{
    if(<baseCondition)
    {
        functionName(parameter)
    }
}


example:
void function1(int a)
{
    if(n>0)
    {
        cout<<a<<endl;
        function1(n-1);
    }
}



example with calling and returning phase
void function1(int a)
{
    if(n>0)
    {
        //calling phase : Ascending
        cout<<a<<endl;
        function1(n-1);

        //returning phase: Descending
        function1(n-1);
        cout<<a<<endl;
    }
}


generalizing the recursion
============================
there are tow different recursion phase 
-->Ascending as the calling phase
-->Descending as the returning phase
but as comparatively for loop have only Ascending phase



Recursion use stack memory of primary memory
==============================================
calling or Ascending phase called n+1 time in stack 

Recursion recurrence form

void function2(int n)
{
    if(n>0)             --> 1
    {
        cout<<n;        --> 1
        function2(n-1); --> T(n-1)
    }
}

total T(n) = T(n-1)+2

recurrence form


         ____
        | 1           n=0
T(n)    |
        | T(n-1)+2    n>0
        | T(n-1)+1    n constant
        |____

T(n) = T(n-1) + 1
T(n) = T(n-2) + 2
T(n) = T(n-3) + 3
        |
        |
        |
T(n) = T(n-k) + k

if n-k = 0
T(n) = T(0) + n
T(n) = 1 + n
     = o(n)
where n= number of calls


Static variable in Recursion
===============================
