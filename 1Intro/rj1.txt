What and how 

a tool for building UI components

how?

react creates a virtual dom in memory instead of manipulating the browser's dom where it does all the necessary manipulating before making the making hte changes in the browser DOM.

it only changes what need to be changed
it find what changes have been made and change changes only what needs to be changed
